Description:"Both R and python free and open source, and were developed in the early 1990sâ€”R for statistical analysis and Python as a general-purpose programming language....in a nutshell, Python is better for data manipulation and repeated tasks, while R is good for ad-hoc analysis and exploring datasets." 
We will use ACLED datasets to showcase Rs possible uses at Tesla Gov.

1.Make a folder on your desktop called RtrainingFolder

2.The first three files ending in .csv or .xlsx need to be in 'raw ' before downloading.
-first, left click the file
-second, click the 'raw' button in the middle right hand corner
-lastly, right click the screen and save-as into your Rtrainingfolder

3.The next two files (.pptx and .pdf) can be downloaded by clicking the 'download' button in the middle right hand corner and move the file to the Rtrainingfolder.

4.The final file needs to be in 'raw' as well before downloading and needs to be moved into the Rtrainingfolder. The instructions for this file are the same as the first three in step 2 except you need to ensure the .txt added at the end is removed.
If this .txt extension is not removed it will not be an Rmd file.
