1. Make a folder on your desktop called RtrainingFolder

2.The first three files ending in .csv or .xlsx need to be in 'raw ' before downloading.
-first, left click the file
-second, click the 'raw' button in the middle right hand corner
-lastly, right click the screen and save-as into your Rtrainingfolder

3.The next two files (.pptx and .pdf) can be downloaded by clicking the 'download' button in the middle right hand corner.

4.The final file needs to be in 'raw' as well before downloading. The instructions for this file are the same as the first three in step 2 except you need to ensure the .txt added at the end is removed.
If this .txt extension is not removed it will not be an Rmd file.
